# GitHub Workflow Agents

Automated agents that maintain and resolve issues using Claude AI.

## Workflow Organization

Workflows are organized by **naming convention** (GitHub Actions doesn't support subdirectories):

### ✅ `core-*` - Core SeedGPT Workflows
**Planted into every new project**

These workflows provide the core SeedGPT functionality:
- `core-issue-generator-agent.yml` - AI-powered issue generation
- `core-issue-resolver-agent.yml` - Automated issue resolution
- `core-marketing-agent.yml` - Marketing automation
- `core-product-agent.yml` - Product management
- `core-qa-agent.yml` - Quality assurance
- `core-sales-agent.yml` - Sales automation
- `core-specialized-agents.yml` - Domain-specific agents
- `core-sanity-tests.yml` - Core sanity checks

### ❌ `apps-*` - Template Apps Workflows
**NOT planted (deleted during planting)**

CI/CD workflows for the SeedGPT template applications:
- `apps-seed-planter-api.yml` - Seed Planter API backend
- `apps-seed-planter-frontend.yml` - Seed Planter Frontend

These reference the `apps/` folder which is removed when planting new projects.

### ❌ `testing-*` - Development & Testing Workflows
**NOT planted (deleted during planting)**

Workflows for SeedGPT framework development:
- `testing-test-agents.yml` - Agent framework tests
- `testing-validate-agents.yml` - Configuration validation
- `testing-test-agents-with-env.yml.example` - Example config

These are only needed for developing the SeedGPT template itself.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Issue Generator Agent (`issue-generator-agent.yml`)

**Purpose**: Ensures the repository always has at least a minimum number of open issues.

**Schedule**: Every 10 minutes

**What it does**:
1. Counts current open issues
2. If below minimum (default: 3), generates new issues using Claude AI
3. Creates realistic, actionable issues based on repository analysis

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# Repository variables (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables)
MIN_OPEN_ISSUES: 3  # Minimum issues to maintain
```

**Manual trigger**:
```bash
# Via GitHub UI: Actions → Issue Generator Agent → Run workflow
# Or via gh CLI:
gh workflow run issue-generator-agent.yml -f min_issues=5
```

### 2. Issue Resolver Agent (`issue-resolver-agent.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automatically resolves open issues by analyzing them with Claude AI and creating PRs.

**Schedule**: Every 10 minutes (singleton - no overlapping executions)

**What it does**:
1. Finds an open issue to work on
2. Claims the issue (adds comment + `in-progress` label)
3. Analyzes the issue with Claude AI
4. Implements the fix
5. Creates a branch and commits changes
6. Pushes and creates a pull request
7. Updates the issue with PR link

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# Repository variables
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_HANDLE: bug,enhancement  # Only handle these labels
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_SKIP: wontfix,duplicate,in-progress  # Skip these labels
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: 8  # Max minutes per run
```

**Manual trigger**:
```bash
# Resolve specific issue:
gh workflow run issue-resolver.yml -f issue_number=42

# Auto-select issue:
gh workflow run issue-resolver.yml
```

## Setup

### 1. Add Secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets**:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Your Claude API key from console.anthropic.com
```

Note: `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions.

### 2. Configure Variables (Optional)

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:

```
MIN_OPEN_ISSUES: 3
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_HANDLE: bug,enhancement
ISSUE_LABELS_TO_SKIP: wontfix,duplicate,in-progress
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: 8
```

### 3. Enable Workflows

The workflows will run automatically every 10 minutes once enabled.

## Customization

### Change Schedule

Edit the cron expression in the workflow files:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'  # Every 10 minutes
    # - cron: '0 * * * *'   # Every hour
    # - cron: '0 0 * * *'   # Daily at midnight
```

### Customize Issue Selection

Edit `.github/scripts/issue_resolver.py`:

```python
# Add custom logic for issue selection
# Example: Prioritize by label
if 'critical' in issue_labels:
    selected_issue = issue
    break
```

### Customize Prompts

Edit the prompt in `.github/scripts/issue_generator.py` or `issue_resolver.py`:

```python
prompt = f"""Your custom prompt here...

Repository: {REPO_NAME}
...
"""
```

## Monitoring

### View Workflow Runs

Go to **Actions** tab to see all workflow runs.

### Check Logs

Click on any workflow run to see detailed logs.

### Workflow Status Badge

Add to your README:

```markdown
![Issue Generator](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/issue-generator-agent.yml/badge.svg)
![Issue Resolver](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/issue-resolver-agent.yml/badge.svg)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running

- Check if workflows are enabled: **Actions → Enable workflows**
- Verify cron schedule is correct
- Check repository permissions

### Authentication errors

- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
- Check `GITHUB_TOKEN` has required permissions

### No issues being generated

- Check Claude API quota/limits
- Review workflow logs for errors
- Verify repository has README and content

### No issues being resolved

- Check if issues have required labels
- Verify issues aren't already claimed (`in-progress` label)
- Review workflow logs for errors

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor the agents**: Check workflow runs regularly
2. **Review PRs**: Always review agent-generated PRs before merging
3. **Adjust configuration**: Tune variables based on your needs
4. **Set rate limits**: Don't run too frequently to avoid API limits
5. **Use labels**: Properly label issues for better agent selection

## Security

- Secrets are encrypted and not exposed in logs
- Workflows run in isolated environments
- PRs require review before merging
- Agent actions are clearly marked and traceable

## Cost Considerations

- **GitHub Actions**: Free for public repos, limited minutes for private
- **Claude API**: Charged per token usage
- **Recommendation**: Monitor usage and adjust frequency as needed

## Examples

### Generate 5 issues manually

```bash
gh workflow run issue-generator-agent.yml -f min_issues=5
```

### Resolve specific issue

```bash
gh workflow run issue-resolver-agent.yml -f issue_number=123
```

### Disable temporarily

Comment out the schedule in the workflow file:

```yaml
on:
  # schedule:
  #   - cron: '*/10 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:  # Keep manual trigger
```
